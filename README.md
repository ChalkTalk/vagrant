## Usage

Prior to `vagrant up`, make sure to set the environment variable
`VAGRANT_GIT_REPO`

To have vagrant automatically deploy a private github repo, use the HTTPS url
with oath token in the format https://<token>@github.com/owner/repo.git

See
https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth

## TODO 
use pip to install `/vagrant/src/requirements.txt`
